# üõ°Ô∏è Datacom Cybersecurity Internship Portfolio

**Role:** Cybersecurity Consultant </br>
**Intern:** Onyekwere McDonald Uchenna

---

## üîç **Project Overview**

As part of the Datacom Cybersecurity Virtual Internship, I assumed the role of a cybersecurity consultant tasked with investigating and responding to a sophisticated cyberattack and assessing the risk posture of a client organization. The project was split into two major tasks:

* **Task 1:** Conducting an in-depth investigation into the Advanced Persistent Threat group APT34.
* **Task 2:** Performing a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment for the affected organization.

Through both tasks, I applied real-world tools and frameworks including **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** and the **MITRE ATT\&CK Framework** to analyze threats, evaluate vulnerabilities, and propose risk mitigation strategies. This project provided me with hands-on experience in identifying cyber threats, assessing organizational risks, and crafting professional, executive-level recommendations.

## üîé Task 1: Threat Intelligence Report on APT34

**Objective:**
To conduct an initial investigation into the notorious APT34 group (aka "OilRig") using OSINT tools and apply the MITRE ATT\&CK framework to recommend actionable defense strategies to the client.

### üß≠ **Purpose of the Task**

The purpose of this task was to identify the threat actor responsible for a targeted cyberattack on a major tech corporation and to assess their tactics, targets, and threat level. This would enable the client to understand the potential impact and prepare defenses accordingly.

---

### üî® **Steps Taken and What I Did**

#### 1. **Gathered Intel Using OSINT Tools**

I utilized multiple open-source cybersecurity platforms such as:

* **Mandiant**, **CrowdStrike**, **Symantec Threat Intelligence**, and **Kaspersky** for group profiles and threat insights.
* **CyberScoop** and **Dark Reading** for news on APT34's latest activity.
* **MITRE ATT\&CK** to analyze their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

#### 2. **Analyzed APT34's Background & Capabilities**

I discovered that:

* APT34 is **state-sponsored** and linked to **Iran**.
* Their targets include sectors such as **oil & gas, finance, government, and critical infrastructure**.
* Their motive is **espionage and strategic advantage**.

#### 3. **Identified Their TTPs**

APT34 uses a range of advanced techniques, such as:

* **Spear phishing** with malicious attachments or links.
* **Credential dumping and password spraying**.
* Deployment of **custom malware** (e.g., PowBAT, Tonnerre).
* **Living-off-the-land** tactics to remain undetected.

#### 4. **Mapped to MITRE ATT\&CK**

Using MITRE ATT\&CK, I linked APT34's behavior to the following:

* **Initial Access:** Phishing (T1566.001)
* **Execution:** PowerShell (T1059.001)
* **Persistence:** Web Shells (T1505.003)
* **Exfiltration:** Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567)

## ‚úÖ **7. Risk Assessment Summary Report**

> ### **Client Risk Assessment Report ‚Äì Summary**
> 
> **Context**:
> The client is protecting a mixture of digital and physical assets such as sensitive databases, financial information, and IT infrastructure. The estimated financial value of these assets is over \$2 million. The perimeter padlock and fence represent initial physical controls, but additional digital safeguards are necessary.
> 
> **Key Risk Scenarios Identified**:
> 
> 1. **Cyberattack** ‚Äì High risk from APT34 and similar actors.
> 2. **Insider Threat** ‚Äì Risk from intentional or negligent employee actions.
> 3. **Physical Intrusion** ‚Äì Risk of unauthorized physical access to infrastructure.
> 
> **Risk Analysis**:
> 
> * **Inherent risk** is very high to extreme across the board due to the valuable nature of the assets and growing cyber threat landscape.
> * **Existing measures** such as padlocks and firewalls reduce risks, but not enough for today‚Äôs threat environment.
> * **Target risk** can be reduced to **low or medium** through added controls: MFA, employee training, better physical surveillance, and access monitoring.
> 
> **Recommendations**:
> 
> * Conduct monthly security audits.
> * Deploy endpoint detection & response (EDR) solutions.
> * Train employees quarterly on phishing & social engineering.
> * Introduce biometric access and 24/7 monitoring for high-risk physical areas.
> * Adopt a Zero Trust architecture to segment access internally.

## üöÄ **Final Reflections**

Through this internship, I gained a comprehensive understanding of real-world cybersecurity practices, from intelligence gathering to risk mitigation. I learned how to:

* Use industry frameworks and OSINT tools.
* Break down and assess complex threat scenarios.
* Communicate clearly with technical and non-technical stakeholders.

This experience not only strengthened my cybersecurity foundation but also honed my ability to think strategically, assess threats pragmatically, and recommend real-world solutions in a professional capacity.
